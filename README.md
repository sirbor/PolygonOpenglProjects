# OpenGL Projects

This README provides an overview of three OpenGL projects. Each project serves as an exercise or demonstration of different aspects of OpenGL. Below, you'll find information about each project, including the project's purpose, file location, and a brief description of its functionality.

## Project 1: Drawing Multiple Graphic Elements

**File**: `Class Project Folder/QuestionOne.cpp`

This project's goal is to showcase the drawing of various graphic elements using OpenGL. It includes the following components:

- At least 2 lines and 2 polygons, each with distinct attributes (different colors, different polygon types, dashed vs. thick lines, etc.).
- 2 points with unique attributes.

## Project 2: Interactive Polygon Creation

**File**: `Class Project Two Folder/QuestionTwo.cpp`

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive OpenGL program that allows users to create polygons using mouse input. The workflow is as follows:

- Users click to add new vertices, forming a polygon.
- Some indication (double click, right click, key press, button click) is made to signal that the polygon creation is complete.
- The polygon is created and displayed on the screen.

## Project 3: Interactive Polygon Transformation

**File**: `Class Project Three Folder/QuestionThree.cpp`

This project extends the functionality of Project 2 by introducing interactive translation, rotation, and scaling of polygons. You have two options for implementation:

1. Keyboard Input:
   - Use arrow keys to translate the polygon by a preset amount.
   - Perform rotations and scaling through keyboard input.

2. Mouse Input with Mode Select:
   - Switch between translation, rotation, and scaling modes.
   - For translation, move the polygon by dragging it with the mouse.

These projects are designed to help you explore various aspects of OpenGL, from basic drawing to interactive user input and manipulation of graphical elements. Enjoy working on these projects, and feel free to adapt and expand them according to your learning and creative objectives.
